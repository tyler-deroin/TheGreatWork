# Introduction

Marriage is such a big topic in human life and always a very strong predictor of people's life satisfaction and happiness level. However, not all marriages are eternal happy endings and a lot of them nowadays end in divorce. If we can understand the factors that influence the quality of marriage, we may be able to discover more preventive measures to help more people maintain a lifelong happy marriage.

To answer this question, our group examined the 2011 UK Census data and limited our scope to the marital status of a sample of British people. 

through descriptive and inferential statistics

To clarify, we define divorce rate here as (total number of divorce or separated)/(total number of marriage). Thus, we exclude all people who have not yet married, and the people who end their marriages out of other reasons such as the other partner's death.  



## Description
The dataset we examined is the 5% sample data of the 2011 UK Census. It contains 2,848,155 observations and 121 variables. Each observation represents a UK citizen
Since the dataset is very large and there are too many variables, we decided to exclusively focus on the relationship between marital status (marstat) and other variables. In brief, we would like to examine the factors that may influence people's marriage and lead to higher divorce rate. Therefore, we selected a total of 17 variables that may be highly correlated with marital status.


We can attach a table of all variables we examined here:

## Social and Economic Status & Marriage 



## Culture & Marriage

It cannot be denied that the cultural package each person has, is a major factor in his conception of marriage, his expectations toward a relationship and his values about divorce. Thus, in this part, we examine the factors of Ethnicity, Religion and Country of birth to try to determine the effect it has on divorce rate. 

These variables are distributed as the following pie charts shows :

```{r, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE}

myowndata[, 'binary_marstat'] <- factor(myowndata[, 'binary_marstat'], levels = c(1,0), labels = c("Separated/Divorced","Married/In a relationship"))

myowndata[, 'ethnicityew'] <- factor(myowndata[, 'ethnicityew'], levels = seq(1,18), labels = c("English/Welsh/Scottish/Northern Irish/British", "Irish", "Gypsy or Irish Traveller", "Other White", "Mixed/multiple ethnic group: White and Black Caribbean", "Mixed/multiple ethnic group: White and Black African", "Mixed/multiple ethnic group: White and Asian", "Mixed/multiple ethnic group: Other Mixed", "Indian", "Pakistani", "Bangladeshi", "Chinese", "Other Asian", "African", "Caribbean", "Other Black", "Arab", "Any other ethnic group"))

myowndata <- na.omit(myowndata)

myowndata$ethngrouped <- ifelse(myowndata$ethnicityew == "English/Welsh/Scottish/Northern Irish/British"  | myowndata$ethnicityew == "Irish" | myowndata$ethnicityew == "Gypsy or Irish Traveller"| myowndata$ethnicityew == "Other White", "White", 
                                ifelse( myowndata$ethnicityew == "Indian" | myowndata$ethnicityew == "Pakistani"| myowndata$ethnicityew == "Bangladeshi" | myowndata$ethnicityew == "Chinese"| myowndata$ethnicityew == "Other Asian", "Asian",

                                               ifelse(myowndata$ethnicityew == "Arab", 'Arab', 
                                                      ifelse(myowndata$ethnicityew == "Any other ethnic group", "Any other", "Mix Group")))))

```

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}

mydata_ethn <- myowndata %>% group_by(ethngrouped) %>% summarise(count = n()) 

lbls <- paste(mydata_ethn$ethngrouped, mydata_ethn$count) 
lbls <- paste(lbls,"%",sep="") 
pie(mydata_ethn$count, labels = mydata_ethn$ethngrouped, col=rainbow(length(lbls)), main="Pie chart of ethnicities")

mydata_relig <- myowndata %>% group_by(religionew) %>% summarise(count = n())

lbls2 <- paste(lbls,"%",sep="") 
pie(mydata_relig$count, labels = mydata_relig$religionew, col=rainbow(length(lbls2)), main="Pie chart of religions")
```


Our assumption is that divorce rate will be higher among white people who are generally considered having more liberal values, and permissive laws for divorce. We also expect that the less committed people are toward religion, the more they are likely to get divorced.


```{r, echo = FALSE}
# Correlation tests
cor.test(filtered_data$religionew, filtered_data$binary_marstat)

cor.test(filtered_data$ethnicityew, filtered_data$binary_marstat)

cor.test(filtered_data$cobg, filtered_data$binary_marstat)
```



```{r, echo = FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# Chi-Square Test

chisq.test(myowndata$cobg, myowndata$binary_marstat)

chisq.test(myowndata$ethnicityew, myowndata$binary_marstat)

chisq.test(myowndata$religionew, myowndata$binary_marstat)
```

Basic correlation tests between the marital status and the different variables (religion, ethnicities, country of birth) indicate that there is a correlation, and there is a similar pattern between them. Our aim is to have more insight about it.

### Ethnicities

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ethn <- myowndata %>% dplyr::select(binary_marstat, ethnicityew) %>% group_by(binary_marstat, ethnicityew) %>% summarise(count = length(binary_marstat)) %>% ungroup() %>% group_by(ethnicityew) %>% mutate(prop = count / sum(count))


ethn_divorced = filter(ethn, binary_marstat == "Separated/Divorced")
ethn_divorced <- ethn_divorced[order(ethn_divorced$prop),]


# Grouping ethnicities

ethn$ethngrouped <- ifelse(ethn$ethnicityew == "English/Welsh/Scottish/Northern Irish/British"  | ethn$ethnicityew == "Irish" | ethn$ethnicityew == "Gypsy or Irish Traveller"| ethn$ethnicityew == "Other White", "White", 
                                ifelse( ethn$ethnicityew == "Indian" | ethn$ethnicityew == "Pakistani"| ethn$ethnicityew == "Bangladeshi" | ethn$ethnicityew == "Chinese"| ethn$ethnicityew == "Other Asian", "Asian", 
                                        ifelse(ethn$ethnicityew == "African" | ethn$ethnicityew == "Caribbean"| ethn$ethnicityew == "Other Black", "Black", 
                                               ifelse(ethn$ethnicityew == "Arab", 'Arab', 
                                                      ifelse(ethn$ethnicityew == "Any other ethnic group", "Any other ethnic group", "Mix Group")))))



```

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
ethngrouped <- ethn %>% dplyr::select(binary_marstat, ethngrouped, count) %>% group_by(ethngrouped, binary_marstat) %>% summarise(grouped_count = sum(count)) %>% ungroup() %>% group_by(ethngrouped) %>% mutate(prop = grouped_count/ sum(grouped_count))  

#ggplot(data=ethngrouped) + geom_bar(aes(x = binary_marstat, y = prop, fill = binary_marstat), stat = 'identity', position = position_dodge())  + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + labs(title = 'ethnicity grouped') + facet_wrap(~ ethngrouped)

#ggplot(data=ethngrouped) + geom_bar(aes(x = binary_marstat, y = prop, fill = reorder(ethngrouped, prop)), stat = 'identity', position = position_dodge())  + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + labs(title = 'ethnicity grouped') 

ethngrouped_divorced = filter(ethngrouped, binary_marstat == "Separated/Divorced")

ggplot(data=ethngrouped_divorced) + geom_bar(aes(x = reorder(ethngrouped, prop), y = prop, fill = ethngrouped), stat = 'identity', position = position_dodge()) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + labs(title = 'Divorce Rate per Ethnicity')

```

The divorce rate shows us some insight that we expected. For example, Asian divorce rate is significantly lower that for White people. The divorce rate is also very high for a person of mixed ethnicities. This might be explained by the fact that a mixed couple requires a more considerable amount of culture adjustment and understandings, and is more likely to divorce. Parents' value about divorce may thus transmitted to the child.
However, one more unexpected result is that divorce rate is the highest among black people. If this trend has been the subject of a lot of studies in the US (e.g. http://www.swaraylawoffice.com/2010/08/divorce-rate-amongst-african-immigrants/), they are quite scarce about UK. 
It is commonly known that Black people are still strongly discriminated against in the US, with inequalities in wages, access to education and higher crime rate. But these do not explain entirely the high divorce rate among Black people in UK as we can see in the Education/Ethnicity cross checking, divorce rate is high among Black people no matter what their education level is. 
Another reason we can think about is the discrepancy between African and European culture. Women in Africa are inferior to men, and confine themselves to domestic role. In UK, the women have the same rights as men, both socially and economically, giving them more independence and possibly leading to frictions.



## Country of birth

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}

## Grouping countries of birth by area

#ggplot(data = cbgrouped) + geom_bar(aes(x = binary_marstat, y = prop, fill = binary_marstat), stat = 'identity', position = position_dodge())  + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + labs(title = 'countries of birth grouped') + facet_wrap(~ cobggrouped)

```

The countries of birth tend to confirm the pattern we already found for ethnicities. 
We can see that the trend of the countries of birth has some similarities with the world divorce ration heatmap you can find following this link: http://i.imgur.com/dep7XIZ.png.


```{r, echo = FALSE}

```
 
 

## Religion

relig <- myowndata %>% dplyr::select(binary_marstat, religionew) %>% group_by(binary_marstat, religionew) %>% summarise(count = length(binary_marstat)) %>% ungroup() %>% group_by(religionew) %>% mutate(prop = count / sum(count))

#ggplot(data=relig) + geom_bar(aes(x = binary_marstat, y = prop, fill = binary_marstat), stat = 'identity', position = position_dodge()) + facet_wrap(~ religionew) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + labs(title = 'religion')

relig_divorced = filter(relig, binary_marstat == "Separated/Divorced")

ggplot(data=relig_divorced) + geom_bar(aes(x = reorder(religionew, prop), y = prop, fill = religionew), stat = 'identity', position = position_dodge()) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) + labs(title = 'Religion')
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
myowndata %>% select(binary_marstat, religionew, ethngrouped) %>% group_by(religionew, ethngrouped) %>% summarise(count = n()) %>% tidyr::spread(key = ethngrouped, value = count)
```
Cross-checking the religion and ethnicities variables, we can observe that the religions with the highest divorce rate are 'Other religion', 'No religion' or 'No stated', which might be a sign of more liberal values.
Buddhists also have high divorce rate, probably due to its permissive point of view toward divorce (https://www.budsas.org/ebud/whatbudbeliev/237.htm). However, the ratio of Buddhists is very low, so their divorce rate has to be taken carefully.
Finally, the next religion with the highest divorce rate is Christianism which is not so surprising. Unlike in Catholic Church where marriage is a sacred union, the Church of England has a more open point of view on divorce (which can be related to the history of Henri VIII divorce). Not to mention that Europeans tend to be less and less committed or involved in religions.


## Age & Marriage
Contains information about the age of the observation (person) in years. This variable ranges from 0 to 90 and is treated as a continuous variable. Ages 70, 75, 80, and 85 are clustered into groups each ranging 5 years (i.e. 70 through 74, 75 through 79, etc...). Furthermore, the 90 age group conatins ages 90 and above.

For the purposes of this analysis, and to calculate the divorce rate by age, the clustered age groups were equally distibuted among the number of ages the group contains. (e.g the 70 through 74 age group was divided into 5 seperate age groups 70, 71, 72, 73, and 74 each inherenting the parent group's divorce rate).

Exhibit 1: Density of un-modified age

The chart below, depicts the density distribution of ages in the dataset before any modifications were applied. As expected, instances of the observations' ages are relatively equal among the dataset, which should ensure a fair representation of all age groups.
```{r}
#need to add in original dataset to show density of original age distribution
ggplot(data = fd, aes(x = age)) + geom_density()
```
Exhibit 2: Divorce rate by age:

The chart above shows the divorce rate (as defined in the introduction) for each of the 83 age groups (18 to 100). 
The divorce rate for observations aged 18, 19, and 20 is significantly higher than observations in their 20's. The rationale for this observation is the scarcity (nominally) of married people who are 20 and less, which results in a large relative proportion of divorced people when compared to other age groups.
The age with the highest divorce rate in the dataset is 48. This is likely due to the fact that younger people are less likely to be divorced, as those would be early-on in their marriages. Furthermore, older people have a greater chance of being deceased and of being remarried.

```{r}

data2 <-  fd %>% filter(marstat == 2 | marstat == 3 | marstat == 4 | marstat == 5) %>% filter(age >= 18) %>% mutate(seperated = marstat) %>% mutate(seperated = replace(seperated, marstat!= 5 | marstat != 4, 0)) %>% mutate(seperated = replace(seperated, marstat == 5 | marstat == 4, 1))

Exhibit 3: Density of modified age

The chart below depicts the density distribution of ages in the modified dataset, wherein the single people in the dataset were excluded as these were irrelevant for our purposes. Furthermor, age groups below 22 were excluded as those were deemed to be outliers, and age groups of 70 and above were excluded as those were manually manipulated to give significance. This shows, as expected a much smoother curve, with characteristics of a bell curve (normal distribution).
```{r}
data3 <-  fd %>% filter(age > 22 & age < 70)
ggplot(data = data3, aes(x = age)) + geom_density()
```

Exhibit 4: Divorce rate by age:

The chart above shows the divorce rate (as defined in the introduction) for each of the 83 age groups (18 to 100). The divorce rate for observations aged 18, 19, and 20 is significantly higher than observations in their 20's. The rationale for this observation is the scarcity (in nominal terms) of married people who are 20 and less, which results in a large relative proportion of divorced people when compared to other age groups.
```{r}
#create new data.frame to calculate the divorce rate per age. This is done by dividing the count of divorced people from divorced data frame by the respective rows from the total group data frame 
divorce_by_age <- data.frame(prop = c(1:83), age = new_divorced$age)
divorce_by_age$prop <- rep(1, 83)
divorce_by_age$prop <- new_divorced$n / new_total_group$count * 100

ggplot(data = divorce_by_age, aes(x = age, y = prop)) + geom_line()
```
Exhibit 5: proportion of divorced people by age

The chart above shows the proportion of divorced people for each age group. The chart shows a curve resembling a normal distribution.
```{r}
ggplot(data = new_divorced, aes(x = age, y = prop)) + geom_line()
```
Exhibit 5: Divorce rate by age and sex

The chart below is an exhibit of divorce rates by age for each sex. The general trend presented is a consistintly higher divorce rate for women across all age groups. This seems to suggest that women are more likely to be divorced than men on average.
A t test of mean divorce rate between men and women reveals a statistically significant difference between the mean divorce rate of men and women.

```{r}
data3 <-  data2 %>% filter(age > 22 & age < 70)
total_group1 <- data3 %>% dplyr::select(age, seperated, sex) %>% group_by(age, sex) %>% summarise(count = n())
divorce_by_age_bysex <- data.frame(age = total_group1$age)
divorce_by_age_bysex$prop <- divorced_bysex$n / total_group1$count * 100
divorce_by_age_bysex$sex <- divorced_bysex$sex
divorce_by_age_bysex$sex <- factor(divorce_by_age_bysex$sex, levels = c(1,2), labels = c('Male', 'Female'))
ggplot(data = divorce_by_age_bysex, aes(x = age, y = prop, fill = sex)) + geom_col(position = 'dodge') + ylab("%")

male <- divorce_by_age_bysex %>% filter(sex == 'Male')
female <- divorce_by_age_bysex %>% filter(sex == 'Female')

## Region/Geography & Marriage
An article on divorce rate by region piqued our interests (http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3201497/Wish-weren-t-ten-divorce-hot-spots-Britain-sea-Blackpool-worst-place-live-want-happy-marriage.html). It lists the top 10 divorce hot spots and they are all coastal cities. The article states that the factors contributing to the high divorce rate in coastal regions are due to the high deprivation and possibly sheer boredoem in winter. In this paper we are keen to explore whether our data attests to the findings of that article. 

Our data shows a significant peak in inner London which shows that the percentage of people in bad marriage (either divorced or separated) is much higher than elsewhere. This is the opposite to the aforementioned article. London is anything but a deprived and boring city. We would like to conduct a hypothesis testing to see (1) if region and marital status are independent, (2) if London has the highest divorce rate and (3) if so what the influencing factors are. The test we adopt here is chi-squared test to explore the correlations between region and marital status and t-test for testing of difference in divorce rates across regions. 

The p-values are both less than 5% and it means that the we can reject the null hypothesis that region and marital status are independent. From the residuals of chi-squared test, we see that married couples are greatly underrepresented in Inner London, but divorced and separated couples are over represented. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# select the data relevant for region
region1 <- dplyr:: select(fd, binary_marstat, age, aggdtwpew11g, region, marstat, transport, wpzhome, Highest_qualification, binary_region_factor, binary_region_num,hours, tenure)

region_count<- region1 %>% select(marstat, region) %>% group_by(region, marstat)%>% summarise(count = n())%>% tidyr::spread(key = marstat, value = count) %>% mutate(divorce_rate = (Divorced + Separated)/(Divorced + Married + Separated))

```

```{r region_plot, fig.width=3,fig.height=3}
# plot divorce rate for region
region1%>% group_by(region) %>% summarise(divorce_rate = mean(binary_marstat))%>% ggplot(aes(x = region, y = divorce_rate))+ geom_col() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1))
```

```{r}
# chi-squared test
region_test <- region_count[,-1]
rownames(region_test) <- as.data.frame(region_count)[,1]
chi_region <- chisq.test(as.data.frame(region_test))
chi_region

```

Chi-squared test residuals on regional marital status analysis
```{r}
round(chi_region$residuals, 3)['Inner London',]
```

We further perform t-test to compare the divorce rate of Inner London and all the other regions. Inner London has a divorce rate of approximately 25%, higher than the average of 20% across all regions. The difference is statistically significant. 

```{r region_ttest, echo = FALSE}
t.test(fd$binary_marstat, fd$binary_marstat[fd$region == "Inner London"])
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
#mean_London <- fdata$binary_marstat[fdata$region == "Inner London"]
outside_london <- fd$binary_marstat[fd$region != "Inner London"]

t.test(outside_london, fd$binary_marstat[fd$region == "North East"])
t.test(outside_london, fd$binary_marstat[fd$region == "North West"])
t.test(outside_london, fd$binary_marstat[fd$region == "Yorkshire and the Humber"])
t.test(outside_london, fd$binary_marstat[fd$region == "East Midlands"])
t.test(outside_london, fd$binary_marstat[fd$region == "West Midlands"])
t.test(outside_london, fd$binary_marstat[fd$region == "East of England"])
t.test(outside_london, fd$binary_marstat[fd$region == "Outer London"])
t.test(outside_london, fd$binary_marstat[fd$region == "South East"])
t.test(outside_london, fd$binary_marstat[fd$region == "South West"])
t.test(outside_london, fd$binary_marstat[fd$region == "Wales"])

```

Could the place people choose to live affect their marriage satisfaction, or is it merely an artifact as a result of distributions of other influencing factors? We plot the divorce rates against other variables in our list and wrap them by region. If the variables have no impact, we should observe the same pattern across all regions, with London having a slightly higher divorce rate. 

Findings: we observe a significantly high divorce rate for people aged 50 and above in Inner London, while inner London is a very young city with mean age of residents at around 47, and median age 45 (population mean and median are both 52). To explore it further we break down the population into two groups: age below 50 and age 50 and above. In the first group we no longer see any significant difference in divorce rates across regions, but the difference becomes more apparent in the second group. The observation suggests a larger proportion of people aged 50 and above are divorced or separated in Inner London than elsewhere. 

According to Office for National Statistics in their online publication in July 2017, while the number of divorces drop by 28% from 2005 to 2015, the number of men divorcing aged above 65 went up by 23% and 38% for women.  (https://visual.ons.gov.uk/marriage-and-divorce-on-the-rise-at-65-and-over/). 

Various factors contribute to the increasing divorce rate among older people (Susan L. Brown and I-Fen Lin 18 Oct 2012, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3478728/). A better economic security, and more social interactions with people are among them. More significanty observed in their data is that people in higher order marriages are more likely to end up in divorces than people in first marriage (53.46% compared to 46.54%). And people in their 50s and 60s are also more likely to be in higher order marriages compared to younger people. 

However we must be careful not to confuse the status of being divorced or separated with the instance of getting a divorce. In our data we look at the percentage of people who are divorced or separated at the time of the survey, without information on when and where the divorce occured. It could also be possible that people in inner London are less likely to remarry after they are divorced, just like London has the highest percentage of singles aged 30 and above. London is fun and people could be just having a good time being single or in relationships, without rushing into any marriage. Above all, London is the number one Tinder hotspots.

### Dependent children

When people get married they are often in love and happy, most married couples look forward parenthood and having children could even strengthen their marital bond. However empirical study shows that the effect of children on marital stability could be very complex. Children increase the stability of marriage only when they are preschool-aged (Becker et al. 1977), as they grow older, their binding force in a marriage weakens; the greater number of children, the smaller possibility of divorce, but the relationship is inversely quadratic rather than linear suggesting the stabilizing effect is the strongest with the first and second child (Xu, Yu and Qiu 2015). 

The birth of an infant often brings couples back together who would have otherwise divorced. Experiencing divorce often place young children at risk for a variety of problems, which may persist into adulthood (Morrisox and Coiro, 1999). Married couples may choose to stay in marriges for the wellbeing of their children but when children are old enough they decide to part their ways. 

We are keen to explore if we observe the same pattern in our data (1) as the age of youngest child grows, the more likely the couple will get divorced/separated (2) the more children a couple have, the less likely they are to be divorced/separated.

## Health & Marriage
```{r message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
mine <- select(fd, disability, marstat, binary_marstat)

mine$disability <- factor(mine$disability, levels = c(1,2,3), labels = c("Limit a lot", "Limit a little", "not limited") )
mine$binary_marstat <- factor(mine$binary_marstat, levels = c(0,1), labels = c("married", "divorced"))
chisq.test(mine$binary_marstat,mine$disability)

```

A chi-square test of the two variables indicate that the correlation between marital status and long-term health problem is significant. This finding suggests that the two variables are not independent of each other. Long-term health problem will influence marital status. 

```{r echo = FALSE}
mine2 <- select(fd, disability, marstat, binary_marstat)
mine2$disability <- factor(mine2$disability, levels = c(1,2,3), labels = c("Limit a lot", "Limit a little", "not limited") )
mine2 <- mine2 %>% group_by(disability) %>% summarise(divorce_rate = mean(binary_marstat))
ggplot(mine, aes(disability, fill =binary_marstat))+geom_bar(position = "fill")
ggplot(mine2, aes(disability, divorce_rate))+geom_bar(stat = "identity")
```
The graph shows that the less severe the long-term health problem, the less the divorced rate.



# Logistic Regression
A comprehensive regression analysis of all correlated variables

The variables presented thus far in this paper are the variables hypothesised to have the greatest effect on a person's likliness of being divorced in a certain society.

As the dependant variable in question is a dichotomous variable (divorced or not divorced), a logistic regression was performed where the divorced status is the dependant variable, and the variables mentioned above are the independant variables.

A logistic model is used to predict the probability of a binary response based on a set of other variables.

Regression formula:
divorced status = intercept + b1age + b2education_level + b3number_of_children + b4religion + b5london_or_not +...


As a measure of the overall model's explanatory powe, three main measures were use:
1) Akaike Information Criterion 
2) c-statistic or AUC (area under ROC curve)
3) The accuracy of the predictions above a certain threshold (the mean divorce rate for our purposes)

The best fit was determined by adding and removing the variables above until the best combination of the aforementioned metrics was obtained.
